        <img src="assets/images/profile-picture.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Profile Picture">

        <p>I graduated magna cum laude from Columbia University in 2016 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Philosophy and Music. Having completed my liberal education (to my current satisfaction, at any rate), I am now pursuing my technical education.</p>
        
        <p>My present ambition is to learn to code in three months ... with no prior experience whatsoever. Though it may be a long shot, my goal is to land an IT job by this summer.</p>
        
        <p>My current coding-related interests skew toward AI programming and video game development. But all of that could quite easily change as I quickly learn more concepts in UC Berkeley Extension's full-time, full-stack, full-night's-sleep-depriving web development boot camp.</p>
